\section{Estimating the firing rate}
Recall that the neural response function $\rho(t)$ represents a sequence of recorded times
at which a neuron fires an action potential (a spike train) i.e.

\begin{equation}\label{response function}
 \rho(t) =: \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta(t-t_{i})  
\end{equation}
where n is the total number of spikes in spike train and $t_{i}$ is the time at which the i$^{th}$ spike occurred.
