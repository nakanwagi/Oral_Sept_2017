\section{Simulation of firing rate and previous time}
In this section, we first review the idea of a specific point process
called an in-homogeneous poisson process.
Next, we model the animal's place fields using a sum of two exponential terms
on which the firing rate is based.
Finally, we simulate spikes based on an inhomogeneous poisson process whose
spiking probability is determined by the firing rate and the sampling step size, dt.
We then use diffusion maps to find a low dimensional model for both our simulated firing rate and previous time data.
