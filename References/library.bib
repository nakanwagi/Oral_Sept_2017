@article{Georgopoulos1982,
abstract = {The activity of single cells in the motor cortex was recorded while monkeys made arm movements in eight directions (at 45 degrees intervals) in a two-dimensional apparatus. These movements started from the same point and were of the same amplitude. The activity of 606 cells related to proximal arm movements was examined in the task; 323 of the 606 cells were active in that task and were studied in detail. The frequency of discharge of 241 of the 323 cells (74.6{\%}) varied in an orderly fashion with the direction of movement. Discharge was most intense with movements in a preferred direction and was reduced gradually when movements were made in directions farther and farther away from the preferred one. This resulted in a bell-shaped directional tuning curve. These relations were observed for cell discharge during the reaction time, the movement time, and the period that preceded the earliest changes in the electromyographic activity (approximately 80 msec before movement onset). In about 75{\%} of the 241 directionally tuned cells, the frequency of discharge, D, was a sinusoidal function of the direction of movement, theta: D = b0 + b1 sin theta + b2cos theta, or, in terms of the preferred direction, theta 0: D = b0 + c1cos (theta - theta0), where b0, b1, b2, and c1 are regression coefficients. Preferred directions differed for different cells so that the tuning curves partially overlapped. The orderly variation of cell discharge with the direction of movement and the fact that cells related to only one of the eight directions of movement tested were rarely observed indicate that movements in a particular direction are not subserved by motor cortical cells uniquely related to that movement. It is suggested, instead, that a movement trajectory in a desired direction might be generated by the cooperation of cells with overlapping tuning curves. The nature of this hypothetical population code for movement direction remains to be elucidated.},

abstract = {Neural circuits must perform computations and then selectively output the results to other circuits. Yet synapses do not change radically at millisecond timescales. A key question then is: how is communication between neural circuits controlled? In motor control, brain areas directly involved in driving movement are active well before movement begins. Muscle activity is some readout of neural activity, yet it remains largely unchanged during preparation. Here we find that during preparation, while the monkey holds still, changes in motor cortical activity cancel out at the level of these population readouts. Motor cortex can thereby prepare the movement without prematurely causing it. Further, we found evidence that this mechanism also operates in dorsal premotor cortex, largely accounting for how preparatory activity is attenuated in primary motor cortex. Selective use of 'output-null' vs. 'output-potent' patterns of activity may thus help control communication to the muscles and between these brain areas.},

abstract = {The precision of the neural code is commonly investigated using two families of statistical measures: Shannon mutual information and derived quantities when investigating very small populations of neurons and Fisher information when studying large populations. These statistical tools are no longer the preserve of theorists and are being applied by experimental research groups in the analysis of empirical data. Although the relationship between information-theoretic and Fisher-based measures in the limit of infinite populations is relatively well understood, how these measures compare in finite-size populations has not yet been systematically explored. We aim to close this gap. We are particularly interested in understanding which stimuli are best encoded by a given neuron within a population and how this depends on the chosen measure. We use a novel Monte Carlo approach to compute a stimulus-specific decomposition of the mutual information (the SSI) for populations of up to 256 neurons and show that Fisher information can be used to accurately estimate both mutual information and SSI for populations of the order of 100 neurons, even in the presence of biologically realistic variability, noise correlations, and experimentally relevant integration times. According to both measures, the stimuli that are best encoded are those falling at the flanks of the neuron's tuning curve. In populations of fewer than around 50 neurons, however, Fisher information can be misleading.},

The activity of cells in such a map would specify the direction in which the s was pointing relative to environmental landmarks and the occurrence of particular tactile, visual, etc., stimuli while facing in that orientation. It is hypothesized that activation of those cells specifying a particular orientation together with a signal indicating movement or intention to move in space would tend to activate cells specifying adjacent or subsequent spatial orientations. In this way, the map would "anticipate" the sensory stimuli consequent to a particular movement.},

Our unifying perspective is based on the maximum entropy principle which is in turn inspired by maximum variance unfolding. The resulting model, which we call maximum entropy unfolding (MEU) is a nonlinear generalization of principal component analysis. We relate the model to Laplacian eigenmaps and isomap. We show that parameter fitting in the locally linear embedding (LLE) is approximate maximum likelihood MEU. We introduce a variant of LLE that performs maximum likelihood exactly: Acyclic LLE (ALLE). We show that MEU and ALLE are competitive with the leading spectral approaches on a robot navigation visualization and a human motion capture data set. Finally the maximum likelihood perspective allows us to introduce a new approach to dimensionality reduction based on L1 regularization of the Gaussian random field via the graphical lasso.},

Investigating the neural control of movement in general, and the cortical control of volitional arm movements in particular, has been a major research focus in recent decades. Studies have involved primarily either attempts to account for single-neuron responses in terms of tuning for movement parameters or attempts to decode movement parameters from populations of tuned neurons. Even though this focus on encoding and decoding has led to many seminal advances, it has not produced an agreed-upon conceptual framework. Interest in understanding the underlying neural dynamics has recently increased, leading to questions such as how does the current population response determine the future population response, and to what purpose? We review how a dynamical systems perspective may help us understand why neural activity evolves the way it does, how neural activity relates to movement parameters, and how a unified conceptual framework may result.},

In neuroscience, traditional methods for sequence comparisons rely on techniques appropriate for multivariate data, which typically assume that the space of sequences is intrinsically Euclidean. More recently, metrics that do not make this assumption have been introduced for comparison of neural activity patterns. These metrics have a formal resemblance to those used in the comparison of genetic sequences. Yet the relationship between such metrics and the traditional Euclidean distances has remained unclear. We show, both analytically and computationally, that the geometries associated with metric spaces of event sequences are intrinsically non-Euclidean. Our results demonstrate that metric spaces enrich the study of neural activity patterns, since accounting for perceptual spaces requires a non-Euclidean geometry.},

abstract = {Laboratory studies of decision making often take the form of two-alternative, forced-choice paradigms. In natural settings, however, many decision problems arise as stay/go choices. We designed a foraging task to test intertemporal decision making in rats via stay/go decisions. Subjects did not follow the rate-maximizing strategy of choosing only food items associated with short delays. Instead, rats were often willing to wait for surprisingly long periods, and consequently earned a lower rate of food intake than they might have by ignoring long-delay options. We tested whether foraging theory or delay discounting models predicted the behavior we observed but found that these models could not account for the strategies subjects selected. Subjects' behavior was well accounted for by a model that incorporated a cost for rejecting potential food items. Interestingly, subjects' cost sensitivity was proportional to environmental richness. These findings are at odds with traditional normative accounts of decision making but are consistent with retrospective considerations having a deleterious influence on decisions (as in the "sunk-cost" effect). More broadly, these findings highlight the utility of complementing existing assays of decision making with tasks that mimic more natural decision topologies.},

The places within the curtained enclosure were specified by four cues (a light, a card, a fan, and a buzzer) in addition to the food. Other cues were eliminated by rotating the maze and the four controlled cues relative to the external world from trial-to-trial. Some units had place fields in both environments while others only had a place field in one. No relationship could be seen between the place fields of units with fields in both environments. All twelve units tested extensively in the controlled enclosure had place fields related to the controlled cues. Probe experiments in which only some of the controlled cues were available showed that some of these units were being excited by one or two cues while others were influenced in a more complex way. The fields of these latter units were maintained by any two of the 4 cues and were due to inhibitory influences which suppressed the unit firing over the rest of the maze.},

abstract = {Quantifying the dissimilarity (or distance) between two sequences is essential to the study of action potential (spike) trains in neuroscience and genetic sequences in molecular biology. In neuroscience, traditional methods for sequence comparisons rely on techniques appropriate for multivariate data, which typically assume that the space of sequences is intrinsically Euclidean. More recently, metrics that do not make this assumption have been introduced for comparison of neural activity patterns. These metrics have a formal resemblance to those used in the comparison of genetic sequences. Yet the relationship between such metrics and the traditional Euclidean distances has remained unclear. We show, both analytically and computationally, that the geometries associated with metric spaces of event sequences are intrinsically non-Euclidean. Our results demonstrate that metric spaces enrich the study of neural activity patterns, since accounting for perceptual spaces requires a non-Euclidean geometry.},

abstract = {1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded. 2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent. 3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other. 4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and VI contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven. 5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer IV, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.},

abstract = {Place cell firing patterns in the rat hippocampus are often organized as sequences. Sequences falling within cycles of the theta (6-10 Hz) local field potential (LFP) oscillation represent segments of ongoing behavioral trajectories. Sequences expressed during sharp wave ripple (SWR) complexes represent spatial trajectories through the environment, in both the same direction as actual trajectories (forward sequences) and in an ordering opposite that of behavior (backward sequences). Although hippocampal sequences could fulfill unique functional roles depending on the direction of the sequence and the animal's state when the sequence occurs, quantitative comparisons of sequence direction across behavioral and physiological states within the same experiment, employing consistent methodology, are lacking. Here, we used cross-correlation and Bayesian decoding to measure the direction of hippocampal sequences in rats during active behavior, awake rest and slow-wave sleep. During pretask sleep, few sequences were detected in either direction. Sequences within theta cycles during active behavior were overwhelmingly forward. Sequences during quiescent moments of behavior were both forward and backward, in equal proportion. During postbehavior sleep, sequences were again expressed in both directions, but significantly more forward than backward sequences were detected. The shift in the balance of sequence direction could reflect changing functional demands on the hippocampal network across behavioral and physiological states.},

These interactions lead to the complex network dynamics that underlie neural computation which, in turn, forms the basis of cognition, perception and consciousness. In vivo imaging allows the study of both form and function in reasonably intact preparations, often with subcellular spatial resolution, a time resolution of milliseconds and a purview of months. Recently, the limits of what can be achieved in vivo have been pushed into terrain that was previously only accessible in vitro, due to advances in both physical-imaging technology and the design of molecular contrast agents.},

abstract = {Most sensory, cognitive and motor functions depend on the interactions of many neurons. In recent years, there has been rapid development and increasing use of technologies for recording from large numbers of neurons, either sequentially or simultaneously. A key question is what scientific insight can be gained by studying a population of recorded neurons beyond studying each neuron individually. Here, we examine three important motivations for population studies: single-trial hypotheses requiring statistical power, hypotheses of population response structure and exploratory analyses of large data sets. Many recent studies have adopted dimensionality reduction to analyze these populations and to find features that are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. We describe the dimensionality reduction methods commonly applied to population activity and offer practical advice about selecting methods and interpreting their outputs. This review is intended for experimental and computational researchers who seek to understand the role dimensionality reduction has had and can have in systems neuroscience, and who seek to apply these methods to their own data. },

abstract = {Laboratory studies of decision making often take the form of two-alternative, forced-choice paradigms. In natural settings, however, many decision problems arise as stay/go choices. We designed a foraging task to test intertemporal decision making in rats via stay/go decisions. Subjects did not follow the rate-maximizing strategy of choosing only food items associated with short delays. Instead, rats were often willing to wait for surprisingly long periods, and consequently earned a lower rate of food intake than they might have by ignoring long-delay options. We tested whether foraging theory or delay discounting models predicted the behavior we observed but found that these models could not account for the strategies subjects selected. Subjects' behavior was well accounted for by a model that incorporated a cost for rejecting potential food items. Interestingly, subjects' cost sensitivity was proportional to environmental richness. These findings are at odds with traditional normative accounts of decision making but are consistent with retrospective considerations having a deleterious influence on decisions (as in the "sunk-cost" effect). More broadly, these findings highlight the utility of complementing existing assays of decision making with tasks that mimic more natural decision topologies.},

abstract = {This work presents three kernel functions that can be used as inner product operators on non-binned spike trains, allowing the use of state-of-the-art classification techniques. One of the main advantages is that this approach does not require the spike trains to be binned. Thus a high temporal resolution is preserved which is needed when temporal coding is used. The kernels are closely related to several recent and often-used spike train metrics which take into account the biological variability of spike trains. It follows that the different existing metrics are unified by the spike train kernels presented. As a test of the classification potential of the new kernel functions, a jittered spike train template classification problem is solved. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Investigating the neural control of movement in general, and the cortical control of volitional arm movements in particular, has been a major research focus in recent decades. Studies have involved primarily either attempts to account for single-neuron responses in terms of tuning for movement parameters or attempts to decode movement parameters from populations of tuned neurons. Even though this focus on encoding and decoding has led to many seminal advances, it has not produced an agreed-upon conceptual framework. Interest in understanding the underlying neural dynamics has recently increased, leading to questions such as how does the current population response determine the future population response, and to what purpose? We review how a dynamical systems perspective may help us understand why neural activity evolves the way it does, how neural activity relates to movement parameters, and how a unified conceptual framework may result.},

abstract = {Projection neurons (PNs) in the locust antennal lobe exhibit odor-specific dynamic responses. We studied a PN population, stimulated with five odorants and pulse durations between 0.3 and 10 s. Odor representations were characterized as time series of vectors of PN activity, constructed from the firing rates of all PNs in successive 50 ms time bins. Odor representations by the PN population can be described as trajectories in PN state space with three main phases: an on transient, lasting 1-2 s; a fixed point, stable for at least 8 s; and an off transient, lasting a few seconds as activity returns to baseline. Whereas all three phases are odor specific, optimal stimulus separation occurred during the transients rather than the fixed points. In addition, the PNs' own target neurons respond least when their PN-population input stabilized at a fixed point. Steady-state measures of activity thus seem inappropriate to understand the neural code in this system. Copyright ??2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The firing rate maps of hippocampal place cells recorded in a freely moving rat are viewed as a set of approximate radial basis functions over the (2-D) environment of the rat. It is proposed that these firing fields are constructed during exploration from "sensory inputs" (tuning curve responses to the distance of cues from the rat) and used by cells downstream to construct firing rate maps that approximate any desired surface over the environment. It is shown that, when a rat moves freely in an open field, the phase of firing of a place cell (with respect to the EEG ??{\{}symbol{\}} rhythm) contains information as to the relative position of its firing field from the rat. A model of hippocampal function is presented in which the firing rate maps of cells downstream of the hippocampus provide a "population vector" encoding the instantaneous direction of the rat from a previously encountered reward site, enabling navigation to it. A neuronal simulation, involving reinforcement only at the goal location, provides good agreement with single cell recording from the hippocampal region, and can navigate to reward sites in open fields using sensory input from environmental cues. The system requires only brief exploration, performs latent learning, and can return to a goal location after encountering it only once. ?? 1994 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Consequently, many models have suggested that the brain is built on simple Bayesian principles.

We studied a PN population, stimulated with five odorants and pulse durations between 0.3 and 10 s. Odor representations were characterized as time series of vectors of PN activity, constructed from the firing rates of all PNs in successive 50 ms time bins. Odor representations by the PN population can be described as trajectories in PN state space with three main phases: an on transient, lasting 1-2 s; a fixed point, stable for at least 8 s; and an off transient, lasting a few seconds as activity returns to baseline. Whereas all three phases are odor specific, optimal stimulus separation occurred during the transients rather than the fixed points. In addition, the PNs' own target neurons respond least when their PN-population input stabilized at a fixed point. Steady-state measures of activity thus seem inappropriate to understand the neural code in this system. Copyright ??2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Place cell firing patterns in the rat hippocampus are often organized as sequences. Sequences falling within cycles of the theta (6-10 Hz) local field potential (LFP) oscillation represent segments of ongoing behavioral trajectories. Sequences expressed during sharp wave ripple (SWR) complexes represent spatial trajectories through the environment, in both the same direction as actual trajectories (forward sequences) and in an ordering opposite that of behavior (backward sequences). Although hippocampal sequences could fulfill unique functional roles depending on the direction of the sequence and the animal's state when the sequence occurs, quantitative comparisons of sequence direction across behavioral and physiological states within the same experiment, employing consistent methodology, are lacking. Here, we used cross-correlation and Bayesian decoding to measure the direction of hippocampal sequences in rats during active behavior, awake rest and slow-wave sleep. During pretask sleep, few sequences were detected in either direction. Sequences within theta cycles during active behavior were overwhelmingly forward. Sequences during quiescent moments of behavior were both forward and backward, in equal proportion. During postbehavior sleep, sequences were again expressed in both directions, but significantly more forward than backward sequences were detected. The shift in the balance of sequence direction could reflect changing functional demands on the hippocampal network across behavioral and physiological states.},

abstract = {Most sensory, cognitive and motor functions depend on the interactions of many neurons. In recent years, there has been rapid development and increasing use of technologies for recording from large numbers of neurons, either sequentially or simultaneously. A key question is what scientific insight can be gained by studying a population of recorded neurons beyond studying each neuron individually. Here, we examine three important motivations for population studies: single-trial hypotheses requiring statistical power, hypotheses of population response structure and exploratory analyses of large data sets. Many recent studies have adopted dimensionality reduction to analyze these populations and to find features that are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. We describe the dimensionality reduction methods commonly applied to population activity and offer practical advice about selecting methods and interpreting their outputs. This review is intended for experimental and computational researchers who seek to understand the role dimensionality reduction has had and can have in systems neuroscience, and who seek to apply these methods to their own data. },

It is hypothesized that activation of those cells specifying a particular orientation together with a signal indicating movement or intention to move in space would tend to activate cells specifying adjacent or subsequent spatial orientations. In this way, the map would "anticipate" the sensory stimuli consequent to a particular movement.},

The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Neural circuits must perform computations and then selectively output the results to other circuits. Yet synapses do not change radically at millisecond timescales. A key question then is: how is communication between neural circuits controlled? In motor control, brain areas directly involved in driving movement are active well before movement begins. Muscle activity is some readout of neural activity, yet it remains largely unchanged during preparation. Here we find that during preparation, while the monkey holds still, changes in motor cortical activity cancel out at the level of these population readouts. Motor cortex can thereby prepare the movement without prematurely causing it. Further, we found evidence that this mechanism also operates in dorsal premotor cortex, largely accounting for how preparatory activity is attenuated in primary motor cortex. Selective use of 'output-null' vs. 'output-potent' patterns of activity may thus help control communication to the muscles and between these brain areas.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {1. We recorded single-unit and multi-unit activity in response to transient presentation of texture and grating patterns at 25 sites within the parafoveal representation of V1, V2, and V3 of two awake monkeys trained to perform a fixation task. In grating experiments, stimuli varied in orientation, spatial frequency, or both. In texture experiments, stimuli varied in contrast, check size, texture type, or pairs of these attributes. 2. To examine the nature and precision of temporal coding, we compared individual responses elicited by each set of stimuli in terms of two families of metrics. One family of metrics, D(spike), was sensitive to the absolute spike time (following stimulus onset). The second family of metrics, D(interval), was sensitive to the pattern of interspike intervals. In each family, the metrics depend on a parameter q, which expresses the precision of temporal coding. For q = 0, both metrics collapse into the "spike count" metric D(Count), which is sensitive to the number of impulses but insensitive to their position in time. 3. Each of these metrics, with values of q ranging from 0 to 512/s, was used to calculate the distance between all pairs of spike trains within each dataset. The extent of stimulus-specific clustering manifest in these pairwise distances was quantified by an information measure. Chance clustering was estimated by applying the same procedure to synthetic data sets in which responses were assigned randomly to the input stimuli. 4. Of the 352 data sets, 170 showed evidence of tuning via the spike count (q = 0) metric, 294 showed evidence of tuning via the spike time metric, 272 showed evidence of tuning via the spike interval metric to the stimulus attribute (contrast, check size, orientation, spatial frequency, or texture type) under study. Across the entire dataset, the information not attributable to chance clustering averaged 0.042 bits for the spike count metric, 0.171 bits for the optimal spike time metric, and 0.107 bits for the optimal spike interval metric. 5. The reciprocal of the optimal cost q serves as a measure of the temporal precision of temporal coding. In V1 and V2, with both metrics, temporal precision was highest for contrast (ca. 10-30 ms) and lowest for texture type (ca. 100 ms). This systematic dependence of q on stimulus attribute provides a possible mechanism for the simultaneous representation of multiple stimulus attributes in one spike train. 6. Our findings are inconsistent with Poisson models of spike trains. Synthetic data sets in which firing rate was governed by a time-dependent Poisson process matched to the observed poststimulus time histogram (PSTH) overestimated clustering induced by D(count) and, for low values of q, D(spike)[q] and D(intervals)[q]. Synthetic data sets constructed from a modified Poisson process, which preserved not only the PSTH but also spike count statistics accounted for the clustering induced by D(count) but underestimated the clustering induced by D(spike)[q] and D(interval)[q].},

abstract = {The firing rate maps of hippocampal place cells recorded in a freely moving rat are viewed as a set of approximate radial basis functions over the (2-D) environment of the rat. It is proposed that these firing fields are constructed during exploration from "sensory inputs" (tuning curve responses to the distance of cues from the rat) and used by cells downstream to construct firing rate maps that approximate any desired surface over the environment. It is shown that, when a rat moves freely in an open field, the phase of firing of a place cell (with respect to the EEG ??{\{}{\{}{\}}symbol{\{}{\}}{\}} rhythm) contains information as to the relative position of its firing field from the rat. A model of hippocampal function is presented in which the firing rate maps of cells downstream of the hippocampus provide a "population vector" encoding the instantaneous direction of the rat from a previously encountered reward site, enabling navigation to it. A neuronal simulation, involving reinforcement only at the goal location, provides good agreement with single cell recording from the hippocampal region, and can navigate to reward sites in open fields using sensory input from environmental cues. The system requires only brief exploration, performs latent learning, and can return to a goal location after encountering it only once. ?? 1994 Elsevier Science Ltd.},
