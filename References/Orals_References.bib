abstract = {This work presents three kernel functions that can be used as inner product operators on non-binned spike trains, allowing the use of state-of-the-art classification techniques. One of the main advantages is that this approach does not require the spike trains to be binned. Thus a high temporal resolution is preserved which is needed when temporal coding is used. The kernels are closely related to several recent and often-used spike train metrics which take into account the biological variability of spike trains. It follows that the different existing metrics are unified by the spike train kernels presented. As a test of the classification potential of the new kernel functions, a jittered spike train template classification problem is solved. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Place cell firing patterns in the rat hippocampus are often organized as sequences. Sequences falling within cycles of the theta (6-10 Hz) local field potential (LFP) oscillation represent segments of ongoing behavioral trajectories. Sequences expressed during sharp wave ripple (SWR) complexes represent spatial trajectories through the environment, in both the same direction as actual trajectories (forward sequences) and in an ordering opposite that of behavior (backward sequences). Although hippocampal sequences could fulfill unique functional roles depending on the direction of the sequence and the animal's state when the sequence occurs, quantitative comparisons of sequence direction across behavioral and physiological states within the same experiment, employing consistent methodology, are lacking. Here, we used cross-correlation and Bayesian decoding to measure the direction of hippocampal sequences in rats during active behavior, awake rest and slow-wave sleep. During pretask sleep, few sequences were detected in either direction. Sequences within theta cycles during active behavior were overwhelmingly forward. Sequences during quiescent moments of behavior were both forward and backward, in equal proportion. During postbehavior sleep, sequences were again expressed in both directions, but significantly more forward than backward sequences were detected. The shift in the balance of sequence direction could reflect changing functional demands on the hippocampal network across behavioral and physiological states.},

abstract = {Responses of cells in the dorsal hippocampus of rats to restraining tactile stimuli as a function of spatial orientation suggest that the hippocampus provides the rest of the brain with a spatial reference map. The activity of cells in such a map would specify the direction in which the s was pointing relative to environmental landmarks and the occurrence of particular tactile, visual, etc., stimuli while facing in that orientation. It is hypothesized that activation of those cells specifying a particular orientation together with a signal indicating movement or intention to move in space would tend to activate cells specifying adjacent or subsequent spatial orientations. In this way, the map would "anticipate" the sensory stimuli consequent to a particular movement.},

abstract = {Tolman's tropistic robot, the "Schematic Sowbug," designed to account for certain facts of "vicarious trial and error" behavior (VTE), fails to do so satisfactorily and employs a mechanism which is not consistent with other behavior mechanisms disclosed by research. An hypothesis based upon Hull's principles of behavior is proposed, postulating that a VTE movement is an incomplete or preparatory response. VTE is not a special form of behavior occurring in a discrimination situation, but is simply a succession of the incomplete and preparatory responses seen when animals are learning to respond to a situation which does not call for a choice. Deductions from this hypothesis are confirmed by data presented from the behavior of rats in a learning situation involving no choice between alternative responses.

@article{Wikenheiser2013b,
abstract = {Laboratory studies of decision making often take the form of two-alternative, forced-choice paradigms. In natural settings, however, many decision problems arise as stay/go choices. We designed a foraging task to test intertemporal decision making in rats via stay/go decisions. Subjects did not follow the rate-maximizing strategy of choosing only food items associated with short delays. Instead, rats were often willing to wait for surprisingly long periods, and consequently earned a lower rate of food intake than they might have by ignoring long-delay options. We tested whether foraging theory or delay discounting models predicted the behavior we observed but found that these models could not account for the strategies subjects selected. Subjects' behavior was well accounted for by a model that incorporated a cost for rejecting potential food items. Interestingly, subjects' cost sensitivity was proportional to environmental richness. These findings are at odds with traditional normative accounts of decision making but are consistent with retrospective considerations having a deleterious influence on decisions (as in the "sunk-cost" effect). More broadly, these findings highlight the utility of complementing existing assays of decision making with tasks that mimic more natural decision topologies.},

abstract = {Most sensory, cognitive and motor functions depend on the interactions of many neurons. In recent years, there has been rapid development and increasing use of technologies for recording from large numbers of neurons, either sequentially or simultaneously. A key question is what scientific insight can be gained by studying a population of recorded neurons beyond studying each neuron individually. Here, we examine three important motivations for population studies: single-trial hypotheses requiring statistical power, hypotheses of population response structure and exploratory analyses of large data sets. Many recent studies have adopted dimensionality reduction to analyze these populations and to find features that are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. We describe the dimensionality reduction methods commonly applied to population activity and offer practical advice about selecting methods and interpreting their outputs. This review is intended for experimental and computational researchers who seek to understand the role dimensionality reduction has had and can have in systems neuroscience, and who seek to apply these methods to their own data. },

In this task, the nervous system faces a type of data analysis problem, for, while a visual scene may be overflowing with information, reaching for the television remote before us requires extraction of only a relatively small fraction of that information. We could care about an almost infinite number of visual stimulus patterns, but we don't: we distinguish two actors??? faces with ease but two different images of television static with significant difficulty. Equally, we could respond with an almost infinite number of movements, but we don't: the motions executed to pick up the remote are highly stereotyped and related to many other grasping motions. If we were to look at what was going on inside the brain during this task, we would find populations of neurons whose electrical activity was highly structured and correlated with the images on the screen and the action of localizing and picking up the remote.},

In contrast to most signal-processing methods, spike metrics operate on time series of all-or-none events, and are, thus, particularly appropriate for extracellularly recorded neural signals. The spike metric approach can be extended to multineuronal recordings, mitigating the 'curse of dimensionality' typically associated with analyses of multivariate data.

The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods. ?? 2006.},
